Customer Life Time Value(CLTV) is a marketing metric that estimates the value of a customer over the history of that particular customer's relationship with a company. The value of a customer to the firm over the life cycle of the customer is determined by Customer Life Time Value (CLTV). It is the money you would make from a customer before churning. The objective of CLTV is to help in decision making in businesses about the amount of money that is to be spent on customers, and how much investment to make in retaining them. A higher CLTV will lead to bigger profits. Various regression algorithms like linear regression as well as XGBoost(Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithms can be used to build a model that estimates the Lifetime Value of a Customer. XGBoost is mostly used for Supervised learning problems, where a training dataset with multiple features is used to predict a target variable. We will apply optimization techniques on xgboost to study the algorithm's efficient performance. We use a dataset from Kaggle which contains the information of customers and policy such as total income earned in a year, employee status, total income earned by a customer in a year, highest qualification and so on and the target variable indicating the customer lifetime value.
